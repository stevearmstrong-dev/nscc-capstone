# Technical Technique Presentation Proposal

## Introduction
- The presentation will focus on utilizing the Random Forest Classifier for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, a critical topic in the field of healthcare business intelligence.
- Data-driven decision-making is essential for healthcare organizations to allocate resources effectively, improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs.
- The goal of the presentation is to demonstrate how the Random Forest Classifier can be leveraged to enhance CVD risk prediction and support data-driven decision-making in healthcare.

## Presentation Candidate
- The presentation will be delivered by Steve Armstrong.
- Steve has 3 years of experience in the IT Industry having worked at companies like Infosys, Telus and Postilize and held roles of Senior Systems Engineer, API Gateway Developer and Full Stack Developer. His Bachelors in Engineering and Graduate Certificate with Honours in Full Stack Application Development from Nova Scotia Community College has helped him develop his problem solving skills. He is currently pursuing the Business Intelligence Analytics Program, closely mentored by his Professor, Patrick Dolinger, a legend with decades of experience in the Data Analytics, Business Intelligence and Data Science space.

## Data Selection
- The dataset chosen for this presentation is a comprehensive collection of variables associated with CVD risk factors, including demographic information, health indicators, and lifestyle factors.
- The data was sourced from https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2023.1150933/full#tab1
- The selected dataset is highly relevant to the healthcare domain as it encompasses a wide range of factors contributing to CVD risk, allowing for a comprehensive analysis and demonstration of the Random Forest Classifier's capabilities.

## Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration
- The presentation will focus on the utilization of data exploration, preprocessing, and the random forest algorithm for predictive modeling.
- The demonstration will walk through the process of applying the Random Forest Classifier to the selected CVD risk dataset, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- The anticipated insights from this analysis include identifying the most influential risk factors for CVD, predicting individual CVD risk scores, and segmenting patients based on their risk profiles. These insights can inform targeted intervention strategies, resource allocation, and personalized patient care.

## Implementation Plan
- The presentation will be developed over a period of 4 weeks
- Required resources include Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib).
- Rehearsals and feedback sessions will be conducted with members of the Prediction Team in the Teams Channel and in person,to ensure its clarity and impact.

## Conclusion
- The presentation aims to showcase the potential of the Random Forest Classifier in enhancing CVD risk prediction and supporting data-driven decision-making in healthcare.
- The audience (students) will be encouraged to explore the application of this technique in their own healthcare business intelligence projects and consider its potential impact on patient outcomes and organizational efficiency.

## Appendices
- The presentation will include references to relevant literature on the Random Forest Classifier and its applications in healthcare business intelligence.
- Additional resources, such as code repositories and recommended readings, will be provided for audience members interested in further exploring this technique and its potential applications.
