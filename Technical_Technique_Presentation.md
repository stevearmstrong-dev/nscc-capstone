# Technical Technique Presentation Proposal

## Guidelines

![Mindmap Technical Technique Presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevearmstrong-dev/nscc-capstone/docs/readme-updates/diagrams/Mindmap_Technical_Technique_Presentation.png)

## Introduction
- The presentation will focus on utilizing the Random Forest Classifier for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk as part of Team Prediction.
- CVD risk prediction is crucial in healthcare for early intervention and preventative measures. Cardio Vascular Disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
- The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Random Forest Classifier in accurately predicting CVD risk using a comprehensive dataset.

## Background
- Current CVD risk prediction methods often rely on traditional statistical models or simpler machine learning algorithms.
- The challenge lies in effectively leveraging the vast array of risk factors and patient data to improve prediction accuracy.
- The Random Forest Classifier presents an opportunity to enhance CVD risk prediction by handling complex datasets with mixed data types.

## Presentation Candidate
- The presentation will be delivered by Steve Armstrong.
- Steve has 3 years of experience in the IT Industry having worked at companies like Infosys, Telus and Postilize and held roles of Senior Systems Engineer, API Gateway Developer and Full Stack Developer. His Bachelors in Engineering and Graduate Certificate with Honours in Full Stack Application Development from Nova Scotia Community College has helped him develop his problem solving skills. He is currently pursuing the Business Intelligence Analytics Program, closely mentored by his Professor, Patrick Dolinger, a legend with decades of experience in the Data Analytics, Business Intelligence and Data Science space.

## Sample Data Selection
- The data was sourced from https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2023.1150933/full#tab1
- The dataset is highly relevant as it covers key risk factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors.

## Technical Technique Demonstration
- The Random Forest Classifier will be explained, highlighting its ability to handle complex datasets and its robustness against overfitting.
- The demonstration will walk through the steps of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using the sample dataset.
- The expected outcome is to showcase the high accuracy and predictive power of the Random Forest Classifier in identifying individuals at risk of CVD.

## Implementation Plan
- The presentation will be prepared over a period of 4 weeks.
- Required resources include Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib).
- Practice sessions and dry runs will be conducted to refine the presentation and ensure smooth delivery.

## Conclusion
- The presentation aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Random Forest Classifier in predicting CVD risk.
- The audience (students) will be encouraged to consider adopting this technique in their own CVD risk prediction projects and explore further enhancements.

## Appendices
- References to relevant technical literature on the Random Forest Classifier and its application in healthcare will be provided.
- Links to the project repository and additional resources for further exploration will be included.
